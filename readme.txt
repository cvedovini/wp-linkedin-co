== Description ==

This plugin is an extension to the WP-LinkedIn plugin providing shortcodes and
widgets to display company profiles and company updates on your blog.

The following shortcodes are available:

* `[li_company_profile]` displays a company profile. You must provide the
company id using the `id` attribute. Optional attributes `fields` and `lang` to
override the general settings.
* `[li_company_card]` displays a company card. You must provide the
company id using the `id` attribute. Optional attributes `summary_length`,
 `fields` and `lang` to override the general settings.
* `[li_company_updates]` displays a company updates. You must provide the
company id using the `id` attribute. Optional attributes `event_type` (by
default the template supports `status-update` and `job-posting`), `start`
and `count`.

There are also two widgets to display a company profile card and a company
updates.

All templates can be customized the same way they are customized in the
WP-LinkedIn plugin.

License purchase includes 1 year of product support and updates.
